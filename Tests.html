<CENTER><H1>Test scripts for Win32::SqlServer</H1></CENTER>
<P>
This text gives some information on the test suite for Win32::SqlServer<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">. I</SMALL> have 
tried to forsee differences your environment that may in relation to mine, but 
it is likely you will see errors if your <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">ANSI</SMALL> Code Page is not Windows Latin-1. 
Which does not mean that Win32::SqlServer only runs with Latin-1. It only means that the 
test script are not perfect. Or so I hope.
</P>
<H2>
Requirements for Running the Scripts</H2>
<P>
Obviously you need <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server. It can be any version of <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server supported by 
Win32::SqlServer. Which tests that are performed depends on the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server version: 
Generally, the higher the version, the more tests. You will not see very much 
&quot;Skipped&quot; though, as the test scripts mainly skips even that part when a test 
cannot be performed because of the server version.
</P>
<P>
One thing is a must for running the entire test suite: you must be running with sysadmin 
privileges. Three of the test scripts create databases and one creates a login. Many scripts also create 
tables and executable objects in tempdb. If the script terminates normally, it 
drops everything it creates. But if a script crashes, you may have to clean up 
manually. Below, I detail what each script creates. It goes without saying that you should not run 
the test scripts on a production server.
</P>
<H2>Running the Test Scripts</H2>
<P>
All test scripts looks at the environment variable <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLLEDBTEST.</SMALL> 
This variable controls which 
server(s) the test scripts should access. <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLLEDBTEST</SMALL> has this format:</P>
<PRE>    Server1;User1;Pwd1;Server2;User2;Pwd2</PRE>
<P>If you don't specify Server1, the test script uses the default instance on 
   the local machine. If you don't specify User1, the test scripts logs in with 
   Windows authentication. Server2 is a second server, and is needed for some 
   tests in the script 9_loginproperties. If you don't specify Server2, or it is 
   the same as Server1, those tests are skipped.  
   Example: to run the test at the server <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">DEVSERVER</SMALL> with Windows authentication, 
   and skip tests that requre a second server, simply say:</P>
<PRE>   SET OLLEDBTEST=DEVSERVER</PRE>
<P>To run the test on your local server and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">DEVSERVER</SMALL> as a second server, now 
   with <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> authentication, you would say:</P>
<PRE>   SET OLLEDBTEST=.;;;DEVSERVER;sa;notstrong</PRE>
<P>The simplest way to run the scripts is to run them with <KBD>MAKE test</KBD>. 
   You can also run them from the source directory as:</P>
<PRE>   perl t/1_resultsets.t &gt; test.out 2&gt;&amp;1</PRE>
<P>The search the output file for &quot;not ok&quot;. Some test scripts run a awful lot of 
   tests (because they iterate over combinations), so you really need to catch 
   the output in a file.</P>
<H2>Reporting Errors from Tests</H2>
<P>If you run a test script and one or more tests fail, please don't just tell 
   me that test 324 in some script failed, put please send me the full output 
   from the script. The test numbers are assigned dynamically in several of the 
   scripts, so I will not be able to find which is test 324.</P>
<H2>The Test Scripts</H2>
<H3>
<B>1_resultsets.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests</B>: the various 
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#RowResultStyles">row and result styles</A>.
</P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 160.</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: Temporary tables only.</P>
<H3>
<B>2_datatypes.t</B> 
</H3>
<P>
<B>Tests:</B> that Win32::SqlServer handle all <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server data types 
correctly. As a side effect it also tests <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_sp">
<NOBR>sql_sp()</NOBR></A>, <NOBR><A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_insert">
sql_insert()</A></NOBR> and that the <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#LogHandle">log 
file</A> is correctly constructed. 
</P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: Many. From a little below 1100 on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;6.5 to over 2700 
on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2005 when you have <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client and the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> enabled.</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: Tables and stored 
procedures in tempdb, and on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 2005 also an <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">XML</SMALL> schema colletcion and three 
<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> user-defined types (the latter only if <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> is enabled).
</P>
<H3>
<B>3_retvalues.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests</B>: retrun values of different data types from stored 
procedures and user-defined functions for <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_sp">
<NOBR>sql_sp()</NOBR></A>.</P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 7 (on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 6.5 and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;7), 33-43 (<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2000 and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2005).</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: stored procedures and 
user-defined function in tempdb, and on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 2005 also an <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">XML</SMALL> schema collection 
and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> user-defined types (if the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> is enabled).</P>
<H3>
<B>4_conversion_t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests:</B> the charset conversion you can set up with 
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#Conversion_Routines"><NOBR>sql_set_conversion()</NOBR></A>. If your <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OEM</SMALL> code page is not CP850 or CP437, this script is 
skipped entirely. </P>
<P>
<B>Notes</B>: the script requires Win32::Registry and will not compile if this 
module is not available. The script assumes that the default character set of your server is Latin-1. If it is
not, it is likely that several tests will fail. </P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 23.</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: temporary 
objects only.</P>
<H3>
<B>5_errors.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests</B>: the error handling. </P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 141. Some are skipped on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 
6.5.</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: temporary 
objects only.</P>
<H3>
<B>6_paramsql.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests:</B> passing parameters to <NOBR>
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql">sql()</A></NOBR>.</P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: From 12 (on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 6.5) to 47 (on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2005 with Native 
Client and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> enabled).</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: On <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2000 and earlier, this 
script does not create any objects. On <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2005, it creates an <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">XML</SMALL> schema 
collection in tempdb, as well as three <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> user-defined types, if the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> is 
enabled.</P>
<H3>
<B>7_objectnames.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests</B>: how Win32::SqlServerlooks up the procedure and table names 
for <NOBR><A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_sp">sql_sp()</A></NOBR> and
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_insert"><NOBR>sql_insert()</NOBR></A>, and also 
how it parses the &quot;typeinfo&quot; argument for the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">UDT</SMALL> and xml data types in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 
2005. </P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 52 (<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL 6.5), 553 (SQL 7, SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2000 and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 2005 with 
<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQLOLEDB), 917 (SQL</SMALL> 2005 with <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client).</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: This script creates no less than five 
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>databases</I></FONT> (two on <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;6.5). Four of 
them have names starting in &quot;OlleDB&quot; or Olle$DB&quot;, and the fifth has all Greek 
letters, &#929;&#949;&#954;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#949;&#961;&#957;&#947;&#969;&#962;. The script also creates objects in these databases and 
adds guest as user.</P>
<H3>
<B>8_threads.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests</B>: Win32::SqlServer with Perl threads. </P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 24.</P>
<P><B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: nothing.</P>
<H3>
<B>9_loginproperties.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests:</B> 
<NOBR><A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#setloginproperty">setloginproperty()</A></NOBR> and 
other connection routines. </P>
<P>
<B>Notes</B>: to perform all tests, this script requires that you have defined a 
second test server with the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLLEDBTEST</SMALL> environment variable.</P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 33, whereof three will be skipped if no second server 
is defined. Some tests are skipped depedning on the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server and the provider. 
Only with <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 2005 and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client and a second server all tests will be 
performed. And even then two tests will be skipped if <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> 
Server is configured for Windows authentication only.</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: Creates a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>database</I></FONT> which it detaches and 
then reattaches with a different names. Both names start with &quot;OlleDB&quot;. On 
<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2005, if <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server authenticiation is enabled, the script creates a 
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>login</I></FONT> 
with the name starting in &quot;Olle&quot; followed by random digits. The script creates the 
login with <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CHECK_POLICY = OFF</SMALL>. As all other objects the test script creates, the 
login is dropped if the script terminates normally. No objects are created in 
the second server.</P>
<H3>
<B>A_rowsetprops.t</B> </H3>
<P>
<B>Tests</B> the properties <B>
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#CommandTimeout">CommandTimeout</A></B> and <B>
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#QueryNotification">QueryNotification</A></B>. </P>
<P>
<B>Notes</B>: This 
script runs for almost a minute, because of a 45-second <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">WAITFOR</SMALL> to test <B>
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#CommandTimeout">CommandTimeout</A></B>. </P>
<P>
<B>Number of tests</B>: 11 (With <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQLOLEDB), 9 (SQL</SMALL> Native Client and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2000 or 
earlier), 16 (With <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client and <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2005).</P>
<P>
<B>Creates in <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server</B>: On <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>&nbsp;2005 
when you have <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client. 
the script creates a <FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><I>database</I></FONT>, OlleQN, in which it creates a broker service 
service and a queue. In the other test cases, no objects are created.</P>
<H2>Subdirectories to t</H2>
<P>
There are two subdirectories in the t directory:
</P>
<P>
<B>Helpers</B> - Here you find the source code for the three <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CLR</SMALL> types that are 
used in the test, and a Perl script to create them. Here is also a short program 
in VB6 which is used to generate and interpret date in regional settings for the
<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#DATETIME_REGIONAL"><SMALL CLASS="allcaps">DATETIME_REGIONAL</SMALL></A> setting.</P>
<P>
<B>Output</B> - This directory holds output files from some of the test scripts. 
Most of them comes from <B>5_errors.t</B>, but also <B>2_datatypes.t</B> and <B>8_threads.t</B> 
generate output files.
