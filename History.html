<H3>2011-08-07 &#8211; 2.007</H3>
<ul>
  <li>Binaries for ActivePerl 5.14 are now included.</li>
  <li>Bugfix: if an sql_variant column or output parameter held a value of the char or varchar data types, the value could have extraneous characters at the end. This was particularly prevalent if the value was the empty string.</li>
  <li>Fixed an error where the handle returned from OpenSqlFilestream was truncated in 64-bit if the handle was &gt;= 2<sup>31</SUP>.</li>
  <li>Various internal cleanups to avoid warnings when compiling for 64-bit.</li>
  <li>Various enhancements to test scripts for Denali and servers with non-1252 collations.</li>
</ul>
<H3>2010-10-29 &#8211; 2.006</H3>
<P>A couple of smaller changes and fixes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Binaries for ActivePerl 5.12 are now included.</LI>
  <LI>You can now invoke <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_init"><NOBR>sql_init()</NOBR></A> as either 
  <CODE><NOBR>Win32::SqlServer::sql_init()</NOBR></CODE> or <CODE><NOBR>Win32::SqlServer-&gt;sql_init()</NOBR></CODE>. Since 
  <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_init"><NOBR>sql_init()</NOBR></A> is intended to be a static routine, 
  the former is preferred, but several people tried the latter, misled by the 
  manual that used <CODE><NOBR>-&gt;</NOBR></CODE> in 
  one place (and <CODE>::</CODE> in another).</LI>
  <LI>Bugfix: Fixed an issue where table-valued parameters and possibly other 
  values did not work properly with <B>threads::shared</B>.</LI>
  <LI>Bugfix: table-valued parameters did not work in the 64-bit version, once you had allocated 2&nbsp;GB of memory.</LI>
  <LI>Fixed a memory leak that occurred that appeared if create Win32::SqlServer objects repeatedly, for instance in a loop.</LI>
  <LI>Fixed issues with how the log file was generated for table-variable parameters and the bit data type.</LI>
  <LI>Added an example to the entry for
  <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#CommandTimeout">CommandTimeout</A> in the manual 
  how to check for timeout errors.</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Note</B>: If you are using ActivePerl 5.10, please beware that the 
included binaries do not run with earlier 10xx builds. I have not tested all 
builds, but the binaries did not run with build 1003. They do run with build 
1007.</P>
<H3>2009-06-21 &#8211; 2.005</H3>
<P>This release brings one single change: there was a bug in the 64-bit version, so if your Perl process allocated more 
than 2&nbsp;GB of memory, Win:32::SqlServer failed to instantiate. This bug has been fixed. </P>
<P>Apart from that, there are some updates in the README about known issues about building from sources.</P>
<H3>2008-08-18 – 2.004b</H3>
<P>It&#39;s called 2.004b, because there are no changes to the module itself. The sole changes are in the test scripts so 
that they run without errors against SQL 2008 RTM. There are also some changes in the build instructions to adapt for 
the changes from CTP6 to RTM.</P>
<H3>2008-05-04 &#8211; 2.004</H3>
<P>The big thing for this release is support for new features in SQL 2008, 
detailed below. At the time, SQL 2008 is still in beta, RTM is scheduled for Q3 
of 2008. Thus I need to add the caveat that there may be issues with 
Win32::SqlServer 2.004 and the RTM release. Rest assured that I will monitor 
this, and relase a new version of Win32::SqlServer if required.</P>
<P>Another big thing is support for Perl 5.10; Win32::SqlServer now ships with 
binaries for ActiveState builds 10xx.</P>
<P><B>Changes for SQL 2008:</B></P>
<P>To have full access to these features, you need to use SQLNCLI10 provider 
that ships with SQL 2008. Win32::SqlServer will use this provider by default if 
it is installed.</P>
	<UL><LI>Table-valued parameters.
		See the section <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#TVP">Working with Table 
		Variables</A> for details for the high-level interface. For the 
		mid-level interface there are two new routines:
		<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#definetablecolumn"><NOBR>
		definetablecolumn()</NOBR></A> and <NOBR>
		<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#inserttableparam">inserttableparam()</A></NOBR>.</LI>
		<LI>The new data types <B><CODE>date</CODE></B>, <B><CODE>time</CODE></B>,
		<CODE><B>datetime2</B></CODE> and <B><CODE>datetimeoffset</CODE></B>. 
		See the section <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#datetime">Date and Time 
		Data Ttypes</A>. There are some incompatibilities in that 
		Win32::SqlServer previous silently accepted if there was garbage at the 
		end of an ISO-formatted date string. Not so any more.</LI>
		<LI>FILESTREAM: Win32::SqlServer provides access to the <NOBR>
		<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#OpenSqlFilestream">OpenSqlFilesteam()</A></NOBR> 
		API, so that you can access FILESTREAM columns using Win32::API 
		functions ReadFile and WriteFile.</LI>
		<LI>Support for large UDTs, that is UDTs that can exceed 8000 bytes in 
		size.</LI>
		<LI>The new built-in CLR types <B><CODE>hierarchyid</CODE></B>, <B>
		<CODE>geometry</CODE></B> and <B><CODE>geography</CODE></B> are 
		recognised, but apart from the name, Win32::SqlServer has no particular 
		support for these; they are handled as any other CLR UDT.</LI>
	</UL>
	
<P><B>Other changes and bugfixes:</B></P>	
<UL>
	<LI>Behvaiour change: previously if you declared a varchar/nvarbinar/varbinary 
	parameter to <NOBR><A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql">sql()</A></NOBR> 
	without specifying the length, for instance <NOBR><CODE>[&#39;nvarchar&#39;, $value]</CODE></NOBR>, 
	Win32::SqlServer would infer the length of the value of the parameter. This 
	has been changed, so that Win32::SqlServer now uses the maximum value, that 
	is 8000 for <B><CODE>varbinary</CODE></B> and <B><CODE>varchar</CODE></B> 
	and 4000 for <B><CODE>nvarchar</CODE></B>. If the value exceeds this length, 
	Win32::SqlServer uses MAX. The reason for this change is that the parameter 
	list is part of the statement that is in SQL Server&#39;s plan cache. By using a 
	consistent parameter length, Win32::SqlServer reduces the cache bloat. For 
	char/nchar/binary, Win32::SqlServer still infers the length from the actual 
	value when none is explicitly provided, but now issues a warning to inform 
	you that this is not good practice.</LI>
	<LI>The variables <CODE><NOBR>$Win32:SqlServer::VERSION</NOBR></CODE> and
	<CODE><NOBR>$Win32::SqlServer::Version</NOBR></CODE> are now
	<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#Versionnumbers">documented</A>.</LI>
	<LI>Bugfix: character-set conversion did not work when there was no default 
	handle. (Which there isn&#39;t if you connect with <NOBR>
	<A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#setloginproperty">setloginproperty()</A></NOBR> 
	and <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#connect"><NOBR>connect()</NOBR></A> rather 
	than <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_init">sql_init()</A>.)</LI>
	<LI>Despite that the manual said that you could use <B><CODE>rowversion</CODE></B> 
	as an alternative to <B><CODE>timestamp</CODE></B>, this was not the case. 
	This has been corrected.</LI>
	<LI>Bugfix: the check for duplicate column names in the result set was 
	broken.</LI>
	<LI>The <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#EXPORTTAGS">export tag</A> <CODE>:consts</CODE> did 
	not include the constants for command states.</LI>
	<LI>Consistent behaviour when you pass an empty command batch. No matter if 
	you pass <CODE>undef</CODE>, an empty string or a string of blanks, the 
	batch is accepted without errors. In 2.003, you got an error for <CODE>undef</CODE> 
	and an empty string, but not for a string with or more spaces.</LI>
	<LI>If you call a Win32::SqlServer routine without specifying a handle, and 
	there is no default handle, you will now get a clear error message up front. 
	The next version of Win32::SqlServer will probnbly warn you rely on the 
	default handle, as this is a deprecated feature.</LI>
</UL>
<P>To build Win32::SqlServer from sources, you now need Visual Studio 2005 (or the .Net 2.0 SDK),
and the SDK for SQL Server Native Client 10 that ships with SQL 2008. See the README for the 
source distribution for further details.
</P>
<H3>2007-07-11 &#8211; 2.003</H3>
<UL>
   <LI>Win32::SqlServer now runs on AMD64. In lieu of hardware to test on, IA64
   is still unsupported. Note that the <CODE><B>
   <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#bigint">bigint</A></B></CODE> data type is
   handled differently on 64-bit.</LI>
   <LI>Added a mid-level routine <NOBR>
   <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#getcolumninfo">getcoluminfo()</A></NOBR> that returns information about
   the columns in the result set(s).</LI>
   <LI>Added a new parameter to <NOBR><A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql">sql()</A></NOBR> and
   <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_sp"><NOBR>sql_sp()</NOBR></A>, <CODE>
   <NOBR STYLE="text-align: left"><A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#colinfostyles">$colinfostyle</A></NOBR></CODE>, that permits you
   to specify that you want information about the columns in the result set
   included in the return structure. You can opt get only names, only position,
   or get a hash with detail information.</LI>
   <LI>Added a new result style, <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#MULTISET_RC">MULTISET_RC</A>, that is very similar to MULTISET,
   but which has row counts instead of&nbsp; empty arrays for INSERT, UPDATE and
   DELETE statements.</LI>
   <LI>Re-implemented the conversion initiated by
   <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_set_conversion"><NOBR>sql_set_conversion()</NOBR></A> to
   use the Windows API, rather than relying on certain files being available in
   System32. This makes about any code-page conversion accessible from Win32::SqlServer.
   There is a new routine, <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#codepage_convert">
   <NOBR>codepage_convert()</NOBR></A>, to convert a single value.</LI>
   <LI><A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#sql_init">sql_init()</A> now has a fifth parameter,
   <CODE><NOBR>$provider</NOBR></CODE>.</LI>
   <LI>Fixed bug that caused a crash on Vista when an <CODE><B>sql_variant</B></CODE> value had
   certain base types.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>2006-04-17 &#8211; 2.002</H3>
<P>Fixed two problems which prevented Win32::SqlServer to run under ASP:</P>
<UL>
   <LI>In the binary distribution, the C run-time is now statically linked with
   the SqlServer.dll, because ASP did not pick up MSVCR70.DLL
      when it was only in the same directory as SqlServer.dll. (Workaround was
      to put MSVCR70 in System32.)</LI>
   <LI>Fixed a problem caused an ASP page with Win32::SqlServer to fail on
      second and succeeding invocations.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>2005-11-27 &#8211; 2.001</H3>
<P>Renamed the module to Win32::SqlServer from the original name MSSQL::OlleDB
 to comply with requirements from the maintainers of the Perl module list (and
 because the original name was more cute than practical). No other changes.</P>
<H3>2005-11-13 &#8211; 2.000</H3>
<P>This is the first release of MSSQL::OlleDB. It has version number 2.000 since
 it is a successor module to
 <A HREF="http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/mssql-sqllib.html">MSSQL::Sqllib</A>.</P>
