<P>Fixed two problems which prevented Win32::SqlServer to run under ASP:</P>
<UL>
   <LI>In the binary distribution, the C run-time is now statically linked with 
      the SqlServer.dll, as under ASP, because it did not pick up MSVCR70.DLL 
      when it was only in the same directory as SqlServer.dll. (Workaround was 
      to put MSVCR70 in System32.)</LI>
   <LI>Fixed a problem caused an ASP page with Win32::SqlServer to fail on 
      second and succeeding invocations.</LI>
</UL>
<H3>2005-11-27 &#8211; 2.001</H3>
<P>Renamed the module to Win32::SqlServer from the original name MSSQL::OlleDB 
 to comply with requirements from the maintainers of the Perl module list (and 
 because the original name was more cute than practical). No other changes.</P>
<H3>2005-11-13 &#8211; 2.000</H3>
<P>This is the first release of MSSQL::OlleDB. It has version number 2.000 since 
 it is a successor module to
 <A HREF="http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/mssql-sqllib.html">MSSQL::Sqllib</A>.</P>
