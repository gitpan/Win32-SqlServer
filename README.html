     This is Win32::SqlServer, a module for calling Microsoft <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server from Perl
     through <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLE DB</SMALL>. </P>

<H3>Brief Overview</H3>
Win32::SqlServer is a module that permits you to access <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server from Perl, by
using any of the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLE DB</SMALL> providers <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQLOLEDB</SMALL> or <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client.
Win32::SqlServer exposes
two levels of interface, a high-level interface and a mid-level interface. The
high-level interface is a developed version of the interface of my older module
<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MSSQL</SMALL>::Sqllib, and largely backwards compatible with this interface. The
mid-level interface exposes a few more knobs at the price of somewhat more
verbose code. A special feature of Win32::SqlServer is the fine-grained control
of error handling.<P>There is no support for <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">DBI</SMALL>. This module does not
   run on Unix &#8211; or any other non-Windows OS for that matter.</P>
<H3>What&#39;s in This Kit</H3>
This is the source-only distribution for <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CPAN</SMALL>,
and do not include any binaries for Win32::SqlServer. If you want a binary distribution
(for x86) please visit <A HREF="http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/index.html">
http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/index.html</A>.
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<P>To run Win32::SqlServer you need:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later. (That is ActivePerl build 809 or later.)</LI>
<LI> Windows NT4 SP6, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003 or Windows Vista.</LI>
<LI> <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server 6.5 or later.</LI>
<LI> <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MDAC</SMALL> 2.6 or <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For details, see the <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#Prerequisites">Prerequisites</A>
   section in the Win32::SqlServer manual.</P>
<P>Prerequisites for building, see below under <A HREF="#build_src">Building from
   Sources</A>.</P>

<H3>Manual</H3>
<P>The manual is in <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html">Win32-SqlServer.html</A>.
   activeperl-copy.pl also installs it as html/<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">site/lib/</SMALL>Win32/SqlServer.html&nbsp;
   There is a <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">POD</SMALL> file as well, but there is no real contents in it, only a
   pointer to the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">HTML</SMALL> file.</P>
<H3>Reporting Bugs or Problems</H3>
<P>Please mail bug reports and suggestions to <A HREF="mailto:esquel@sommarskog.se">
esquel@sommarskog.se</A>. Try to make your reports as specific as possible.
Particularly do not forget to include which versions of Perl, Windows, <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server
etc you are using.</P>
<P>
I usually try to respond within 24-48 hours, but if I am on holiday I am.</P>
<H2><A NAME="build_src">Building from Sources</A></H2>
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<P>To build Win32::SqlServer you need:</P>
<UL>
<LI> The Platform <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> for Windows, more
   precisely, the Core <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> and the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MDAC SDK</SMALL>.
   The Platform <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> comes with Visual Studio. You can
   also download it from
   <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx">
   http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx</A>. (Specify Platform <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL>
   as Product/Technology.) </LI>
<LI> The header file for <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client <B>sqlncli.h</B>. This file comes
   with the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> for <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server 2005. I don&#39;t
   think it is available as a
   separate download, but you can always download the free <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Express edition. When you install <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Express, you must uncheck<I>
   Hide advanced configuration options</I>, as the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> is not installed by
   default.</LI>
<LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later.</LI>
<LI>
   <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">A C</SMALL>++ compiler, preferrably Visual C++ 7.0 or later. (The C++ compiler that
   comes with Visual Studio&nbsp;6 will <B>not</B> work.) If you don&#39;t have
      Visual Studio, you can download the .Net Framework SDK (link as above),
      there is a C++ compiler included. I have no idea whether Win32::SqlServer compiles
      with other C++ compilers than Microsoft&#39;s. </LI>
<LI> A make facility. You can get Microsofts <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">NMAKE</SMALL> (for x86) on:
     <A HREF="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MSLFILES</SMALL>/nmake15.exe</A></LI>
</UL>

<H3>How to Build and Install</H3>
<P>Text in <KBD>this type face</KBD> indicates command you run from the command
prompt.</P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>Extract the zip file anywhere you like.</LI>
<LI>Edit <B>makefile.pl</B> so that <CODE>$SQLDIR</CODE> points to where <B>sqlncli.h</B> is
   located.</LI>
<LI><B>makefile.pl</B> also includes a <I>dynamic_lib</I> option, which I don&#39;t
   know whether it will work with other compilers than Visual C++. For better
   startup performance, you are encouraged to find the corresponding
   command-line option for your compiler. However, you can remove it if you
   don&#39;t care.</LI>
<LI>Note that <B>makefile.pl</B> explicitly lists which libraries to link with,
   and specifies the MT flag for the C compiler. This is to force use of the
   static C run-time library for Visual C++, which is what I want for the binary
   distribution. Change this if you like.</LI>
<LI>Open a Command Prompt, and change directory to where you extracted the
   files.</LI>
<LI><KBD>Perl makefile.pl</KBD>. </LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE</KBD><BR/>Or <KBD>NMAKE</KBD>, <KBD>DMAKE</KBD> or whatever your
   <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MAKE</SMALL> utility you use.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE test</KBD><BR/>Before you run the tests, please read <B>
   <A HREF="Tests.html">tests.html</A></B>
   so that you understand what impact the test scripts have on your server. This
   document also describes how to set the environment variable
   <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLLEDBTEST</SMALL>, from
   which the test scripts get information how to log into <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE install</KBD></LI>
