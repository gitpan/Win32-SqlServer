<H3>Brief Overview</H3>
Win32::SqlServer is a module that permits you to access <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server from Perl, by
using any of the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLE DB</SMALL> providers <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQLOLEDB</SMALL> or <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Native Client.
Win32::SqlServer exposes
two levels of interface, a high-level interface and a mid-level interface. The
high-level interface is a developed version of the interface of my older module
<SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MSSQL</SMALL>::Sqllib, and largely backwards compatible with this interface. The
mid-level interface exposes a few more knobs at the price of somewhat more
verbose code. A special feature of Win32::SqlServer is the fine-grained control
of error handling.<P>There is no support for <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">DBI</SMALL>. This module does not
   run on Unix &#8211; or any other non-Windows OS for that matter.</P>
<H3>What&#39;s in This Kit</H3>
This is the source-only distribution for <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">CPAN</SMALL>,
and do not include any binaries for Win32::SqlServer. If you want a binary distribution
(for x86 or AMD64) please visit <A HREF="http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/index.html">
http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/index.html</A>.
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<P>To run Win32::SqlServer you need:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later. (That is ActivePerl build 809 or later.)</LI>
<LI> Windows NT4 SP6, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003, Windows Vista or
Windows 2008.</LI>
<LI> <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server 6.5 or later.</LI>
<LI> <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MDAC</SMALL> 2.6 or <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL>
Server Native Client.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For details, see the <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#Prerequisites">Prerequisites</A>
   section in the Win32::SqlServer manual.</P>
<P>Prerequisites for building, see below under <A HREF="#build_src">Building from
   Sources</A>.</P>

<H3>Manual</H3>
<P>The manual is in <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html">Win32-SqlServer.html</A>.
   There is a <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">POD</SMALL> file as well, but there is no real contents in it, only a
   pointer to the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">HTML</SMALL> file.</P>
<H3>Reporting Bugs or Problems</H3>
<P>Please mail bug reports and suggestions to <A HREF="mailto:esquel@sommarskog.se">
esquel@sommarskog.se</A>. Try to make your reports as specific as possible.
Particularly do not forget to include which versions of Perl, Windows, <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server
etc you are using.</P>
<P>
I usually try to respond within 24-48 hours, but if I am on holiday I am.</P>
<H2><A NAME="build_src">Building from Sources</A></H2>
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<P>To build Win32::SqlServer you need:</P>
<UL>
<LI> The Platform <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> for Windows, more
   precisely, the Core <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> and the <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MDAC SDK</SMALL>.
   The Platform <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SDK</SMALL> comes with Visual Studio. You can
   also download the
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F26B1AA4-741A-433A-9BE5-FA919850BDBF&amp;displaylang=en">Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5</A>.
(The link is the current as of this writing. Microsoft often twitches things
around, so you have to search for it.)</LI>
<LI> The SDK (header files and link libraries) for SQL Server Native client that
comes with SQL 2008. (The SDK for SQL 2005 won&#39;t do.) </LI>
   <LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later.</LI>
<LI>
    <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">A C</SMALL>++ compiler, preferably Visual C++ 8.0 or later. (The C++ compiler that
   comes with Visual Studio&nbsp;6 will <B>not</B> work.) If you don&#39;t have
   Visual Studio, the Windows SDK (see above), comes with one.</LI>
<LI> A make facility. Microsoft&#39;s <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">NMAKE</SMALL> also
comes with the Windows SDK.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>How to Build and Install</H3>
<P>Text in <KBD>this type face</KBD> indicates command you run from the command
prompt.</P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>Extract the zip file anywhere you like.</LI>
<LI>Edit <B>makefile.pl</B> so that <CODE>$SQLDIR</CODE> points to where <B>sqlncli.h</B> is
   located.</LI>
<LI>If you use a different compiler from Visual C++, you need to review
makefile.pl more closely. <B>makefile.pl</B> includes two linker options
specifed with <I>dynamic_lib</I> option that are likely to work only with Visual C++.
<B>/base</B> is only there to set a difference base address for better startup
performance. <B>/delayload</B> is more important: it defers the loading of
sqlncli10.dll until it&#39;s actually needed, or more precisely until you call
OpenSqlFilestream. Without /delayload, Win32::SqlServer would not run on systems
without SQL Server Native Client 10. If you use a different compiler than VC++,
this is something you need to address.</LI>
<LI>Note that <B>makefile.pl</B> explicitly lists which libraries to link with,
   and specifies the MT flag for the C compiler. This is to force use of the
   static C run-time library for Visual C++, which is what I want for the binary
   distribution. Change this if you like.</LI>
<LI>Open a Command Prompt, and change directory to where you extracted the
   files.</LI>
<LI><KBD>Perl makefile.pl</KBD>. </LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE</KBD><BR/>Or <KBD>NMAKE</KBD>, <KBD>DMAKE</KBD> or whatever your
   <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">MAKE</SMALL> utility you use.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE test</KBD><BR/>Before you run the tests, please read <B>
   <A HREF="Tests.html">tests.html</A></B>
   so that you understand what impact the test scripts have on your server. This
   document also describes how to set the environment variable
   <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">OLLEDBTEST</SMALL>, from
   which the test scripts get information how to log into <SMALL CLASS="allcaps">SQL</SMALL> Server.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE install</KBD></LI>

<H4><SPAN LANG="sv">ActivePerl</SPAN></H4>
<P><SPAN LANG="sv">Win32::SqlServer does not build for x86 with ActivePerl builds 1004 and 1005, because of a bug in
ExtUtils::MM_Win32. I&#39;ve <A HREF="http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=61492">reported the bug</A>, and it
was closed as fixed well before build 1005 came out, but 1005 does not include the fix. To build Win32::SqlServer for
x86 with ActivePerl, you need build 1002. (Maybe build 1003, I have not tested that build.)</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN LANG="sv">The bug does not affect building Win32::SqlServer for the x64 architecture.</SPAN></P>

<P><SPAN LANG="sv">To be honest, I have no idea if that will work. I have certainly not tested, and nor do I plan to.</SPAN></P>
