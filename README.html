<P>
     This is Win32::SqlServer, a module for calling Microsoft SQL Server from Perl
     through OLE DB. </P>

<H3>Brief Overview</H3>
Win32::SqlServer is a module that permits you to access SQL Server from Perl, by
using any of the OLE DB providers SQLOLEDB or SQL Server Native Client.
Win32::SqlServer exposes
two levels of interface, a high-level interface and a mid-level interface. The
high-level interface is a developed version of the interface of my older module
MSSQL::Sqllib, and largely backwards compatible with this interface. The
mid-level interface exposes a few more knobs at the price of somewhat more
verbose code. A special feature of Win32::SqlServer is the fine-grained control
of error handling.
<P>There is no support for DBI. This module does not
   run on Unix &#8211; or any other non-Windows OS for that matter.</P>
<H3>What&#39;s in This Kit</H3>
This is the source-only distribution for CPAN,
and do not include any binaries for Win32::SqlServer. If you want a binary distribution
(for x86 or AMD64) please visit <A HREF="http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/index.html">
http://www.sommarskog.se/mssqlperl/index.html</A>.
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<P>To run Win32::SqlServer you need:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later. (That is ActivePerl build 809 or later.)</LI>
<LI> Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows.</LI>
<LI> SQL Server 6.5 or later.</LI>
<LI> MDAC 2.6 or SQL
Server Native Client.</LI>
</UL>

<P>For details, see the <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html#Prerequisites">Prerequisites</A>
   section in the Win32::SqlServer manual.</P>
<P>Prerequisites for building, see below under <A HREF="#build_src">Building from
   Sources</A>.</P>
<P>Notes:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>While Win32::SqlServer may run against SQL Azure (or Windows Azure SQL Database as it is currently called), I don't really claim to supported, since I don't have any account on Azure myself.</LI>
  <LI><B>Win32::SqlServer 2.008 will be the last version to support SQL Server 6.5</B>.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Manual</H3>
<P>The manual is in <A HREF="Win32-SqlServer.html">Win32-SqlServer.html</A>.
   There is a POD file as well, but there is no real contents in it, only a
   pointer to the HTML file.</P>
<H3>Reporting Bugs or Problems</H3>
<P>Please mail bug reports and suggestions to <A HREF="mailto:esquel@sommarskog.se">
esquel@sommarskog.se</A>. Try to make your reports as specific as possible.
Particularly do not forget to include which versions of Perl, Windows, SQL Server
etc you are using.</P>
<P>
I usually try to respond within 24-48 hours, but if I am on holiday I am.</P>
<H2><A NAME="build_src">Building from Sources</A></H2>
<H3>Prerequisites</H3>
<P>To build Win32::SqlServer you need:</P>
<UL>
<LI> The Platform SDK for Windows, more
   precisely, the Core SDK and the MDAC SDK.
   The Platform SDK comes with Visual Studio. You can
   also download the
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=F26B1AA4-741A-433A-9BE5-FA919850BDBF&amp;displaylang=en">Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework 3.5</A>.
(The link is the current as of this writing. Microsoft often twitches things
around, so you have to search for it.)</LI>
<LI> The SDK (header files and link libraries) for SQL Server Native client that
comes with SQL 2012. (The SDK for SQL 2008 or earlier will not do.) </LI>
   <LI> Perl 5.8.3 or later.</LI>
<LI>
    A C++ compiler, preferably Visual C++ 8.0 or later. (The C++ compiler that
   comes with Visual Studio&nbsp;6 will <B>not</B> work.) If you don&#39;t have
   Visual Studio, the Windows SDK (see above), comes with one.</LI>
<LI> A make facility. Microsoft&#39;s NMAKE also
comes with the Windows SDK.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>How to Build and Install</H3>
<P>Text in <KBD>this type face</KBD> indicates command you run from the command
prompt.</P>
<OL TYPE=1>
<LI>Extract the zip file anywhere you like.</LI>
<LI>Edit <B>makefile.pl</B> so that <CODE>$SQLDIR</CODE> points to where <B>sqlncli.h</B> is
   located.</LI>
<LI>If you use a different compiler from Visual C++, you need to review
makefile.pl more closely as <B>makefile.pl</B> may include options that are specific to Visual C++.</LI>
<LI>Note that <B>makefile.pl</B> explicitly lists which libraries to link with,
   and specifies the MT flag for the C compiler. This is to force use of the
   static C run-time library for Visual C++, which is what I want for the binary
   distribution. Change this if you like.</LI>
<LI>Open a Command Prompt, and change directory to where you extracted the
   files.</LI>
<LI><KBD>Perl makefile.pl</KBD>. </LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE</KBD><BR/>Or <KBD>NMAKE</KBD>, <KBD>DMAKE</KBD> or whatever your
   MAKE utility you use.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE test</KBD><BR/>Before you run the tests, please read <B>
   <A HREF="Tests.html">tests.html</A></B>
   so that you understand what impact the test scripts have on your server. This
   document also describes how to set the environment variable
   OLLEDBTEST, from
   which the test scripts get information how to log into SQL Server.</LI>
<LI><KBD>MAKE install</KBD></LI>

<H3>Known Issues</H3>
<H4>ActivePerl</H4>
<P>Win32::SqlServer does not build for x86 with ActivePerl builds 1004 and 1005, because of a bug in
ExtUtils::MM_Win32. I&#39;ve <A HREF="http://rt.perl.org/rt3//Public/Bug/Display.html?id=61492">reported the bug</A>, and it
was closed as fixed well before build 1005 came out, but 1005 does not include the fix. To build Win32::SqlServer for
x86 with ActivePerl, you need build 1002 or build 1007 or later. (Maybe builds 1003 
and 1006 are OK too, I have not tested those builds.)</P>
<P>The bug does not affect building Win32::SqlServer for the x64 architecture.</P>
<H4>Other Compilers than Visual C++</H4>
<P>To be honest, I have no idea if that will work. I have certainly not tested, and nor do I plan to. 
This includes other Perl distriutions, such as Strawberry Perl. </P>
